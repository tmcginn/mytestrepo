# Build the Oracle Database Docker Image

## Introduction
A Docker image contains all of the necessary code to execute an application for a host kernel. In this lab, you will create a Docker image for Oracle Database 19c.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives
This lab walks you through the steps to build an Oracle Database Docker image on an Oracle Cloud compute instance.


### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Cloud paid account or free trial. To sign up for a trial account with $300 in credits for 30 days, click [here](http://oracle.com/cloud/free)
* SSH keys
* Docker installed on an Oracle Cloud compute instance.

## **STEP 1**: Install Docker build files from GitHub

Oracle has provided a complete set of Docker build files on an Oracle GitHub repository. There are several ways to get the files to the compute instance, but for simplicity, you will use GitHub's download option.

1. If you don't have an open SSH connection to your compute instance, open a Terminal window. Navigate to the folder where you created the SSH keys and connect using the public IP address of your compute instance:

    ```
    $ <copy>ssh -i ./myOracleCloudKey opc@</copy>123.123.123.123
    Enter passphrase for key './myOracleCloudKey':
    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$
    ```

2. Use the `wget` to download the repository on the compute instance:

    ```
    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$ <copy>wget https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/archive/master.zip</copy>
    --2020-04-07 18:23:39--  https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/archive/master.zip
    Resolving github.com (github.com)... 140.82.112.4
    Connecting to github.com (github.com)|140.82.112.4|:443... connected.

    Saving to: ‘master.zip’

        [  <=>                                                                                      ] 2,797,020   12.1MB/s   in 0.2s

    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$
    ```
3. Unzip the repository on your compute instance:

    ```
    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$ <copy>unzip master.zip</copy>
    Archive:  master.zip
    7e03e466934753bc547c1919729702e5f33e4eba
       creating: docker-images-master/
    ...

      inflating: docker-images-master/OracleWebLogic/samples/wls-k8s-domain/k8s/pv.yml
      inflating: docker-images-master/OracleWebLogic/samples/wls-k8s-domain/k8s/pvc.yml

      inflating: docker-images-master/README.md
    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$
    ```

## **STEP 2**: Upload Oracle Database zip to your compute instance

Choose the environment where you created your SSH Key.

### Oracle Cloud Shell
1. Oracle Database 19c (19.3) for Linux x86-64 has been uploaded to Oracle Object Storage for you. Download the zip file to your compute instance by using its Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR) URL. Open your Cloud Shell, navigate to the folder where you created the SSH keys, and connect using:
    ```
    $ <copy>ssh -i ./myOracleCloudKey opc@</copy>123.123.123.123
    ```

  Navigate to the folder where you want to put your image zip file.
    ```
    <copy>cd docker-images-master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0</copy>
    ```

  Download the zip file to this folder.
    ```
    <copy>wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/LK1k7CgQxR2LcgcF1sG8E0Z_B3q3yNC4H62dZQ8xaSr7OBN7D6lcpIutXF17oZU6/n/c4u03/b/data-management-library-files/o/LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip</copy>
    ```

  ![](images/download_PAR.png " ")

  You have finished uploading Oracle Database zip to your compute instance. You can now *move to Step 3*

### Other
1. Download Oracle Database 19c (19.3) for Linux x86-64 to your local machine from [Oracle Technology Network](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle19c-linux-downloads.html).

  ![](images/otn-download.png " ")

2. Transfer the zip file to your compute instance. Open a new Terminal window, navigate to the folder where you created the SSH keys, and connect using `sftp` and the public IP address of your compute instance:

    ```
    <copy>sftp -i ./myOracleCloudKey opc@</copy>123.123.123.123
    Enter passphrase for key './myOracleCloudKey':
    Connected to 129.213.35.186.
    sftp&gt;
    ```

3. Change to the local directory (on your PC) where you downloaded Oracle Database:

    ```
    sftp>     lcd <path to the zip file on your PC>
    sftp>
    ```

4. Change directories on the compute instance to the `19.3.0` directory of the Docker repo. It is important that you put the Oracle Database installation zip file into the directory that is named the same as the Database version.


    ```
    sftp&gt;     <copy>cd docker-images-master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0</copy>
    sftp&gt;
    ```

5. Use the `put` command to copy the zip file to the Compute instance. When it is complete you can exit `sftp`. Depending on your local internet bandwidth, the upload can take up to 2 hours. **Do not unzip the file.**

    ```
    sftp&gt;     <copy>put LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip</copy>
    Uploading LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip to /home/opc/docker-images-master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0/LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip
    LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip                                        8%  248MB  29.5MB/s   01:30 ETA
    ...
    LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip                                      100% 2918MB  32.4MB/s   01:30
    sftp&gt;     exit
    ```

## **STEP 3**: Build the Docker image

1. In the terminal window connected to your compute instance (your previous Terminal window), change directories to the `dockerfiles` directory:

    ```
    [opc@oraclelinux77 ~]$<copy>cd docker-images-master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles</copy>
    [opc@oraclelinux77 dockerfiles]$
    ```

2. Build the Docker image using the `buildDockerImage` script. This process may take around 30 minutes.
   Be sure to read the [README.md](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/README.md) file which explains the build process in greater detail.

    ```
    [opc@oraclelinux77 dockerfiles]$ <copy>./buildDockerImage.sh -v 19.3.0 -e</copy>
    Checking Docker version.
    Checking if required packages are present and valid...
    LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip: OK

        --> oracle/database:19.3.0-ee

      Build completed in 1850 seconds.

    [opc@oraclelinux77 dockerfiles]$
    ```

  Note when the script completes, it lists the new Docker image: `oracle/database:19.3.0-ee`.

  You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
